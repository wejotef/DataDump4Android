# DataDump4Android

Because you probably don't need to run the DataDump4Android.bat file frequently, you can store it in the "C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Documents" folder or any other directory that you prefer for personal scripts and files.
Alternatively, you can use the "C:\Windows\System32" folder if you want it to be accessible system-wide, but be cautious with this approach as it can clutter the folder and potentially cause conflicts with system files.
